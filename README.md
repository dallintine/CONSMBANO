Introduction
The Nursing Management App is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management of students, staff, and operations within a nursing school. It aims to simplify administrative tasks, improve communication, and enhance the overall management experience for educational institutions 

This app offers features that cater to both academic and operational needs, such as:

1. Student management: Monitoring attendance, performance tracking, and academic progress.
2. Staff management: Handling staff attendance, payroll, and scheduling.
3. Biometric attendance: Using fingerprint technology for accurate attendance tracking, reducing manual errors.
4. Subscription and Payment Management: Ensuring that payment statuses and subscriptions are managed in real-time, with automatic access control based on subscription duration and payment completion.
   
By digitizing and automating many time-consuming processes in nursing school management, this app enhances operational efficiency and allows administrators to focus on providing high-quality education. Its user-friendly design ensures easy navigation for users with varying technical proficiency, and its robust backend supports secure and scalable management of critical institutional data

2. Prerequisites
Ensure that the following software and tools are installed on your system:

XAMPP or WAMP (for Windows users) or LAMP (for Linux users) to run Apache and MySQL.
PHP (version 7.4 or higher)
Composer (for PHP dependency management)
Git (for version control, if you want to clone the repository)

cd CONSMBANO
c. Install PHP Dependencies

Make sure Composer is installed on your machine, then run the following command to install all necessary PHP packages:

composer install
d. Configure the Database

Set up a MySQL database on your local machine.

Create a new database in MySQL (e.g., nursing_management_db):

CREATE DATABASE nursing_management_db;

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=nursing_management_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234

Run the database migrations and seed data (if included):

php artisan migrate
php artisan db: seed

e. Set Up Environment Variables

If using an .env file, ensure the following configurations are correct:

APP_NAME="Nursing Management App"
APP_URL=http://College-of-Nursing-Sciences

f. Start the Local Server
If you're using PHPâ€™s built-in server, run:



php artisan serve
Alternatively, start XAMPP/WAMP or any other local server with Apache and navigate to the app folder.

g. Set Up Biometric Devices (Optional)

If using biometric devices (like the U.Are.U 4500), ensure the SDK is installed and properly configured on your system.

4. Access the App
Once the installation is complete and the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to: 


http://localhost/College-of-Nursing-Sciences
You should now be able to access the Nursing Management App dashboard.

5. Admin Setup
Log in with the default admin credentials or set up an admin account through the database 

Username: admin
Password: password (you will be prompted to change this after logging in for the first time )

6. Troubleshooting
   
If you encounter permission issues, ensure that the storage and bootstrap/cache directories are writable:

chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache

Check PHP and server logs if you face any issues during installation or runtime.

By following the above steps, you should have the Nursing Management App installed and running locally

5. Biometric Attendance System
For Students: Using the U.Are.U 4500 biometric device, students can log their attendance by scanning their fingerprints.
For Staff: Similarly, staff members can log their attendance using the biometric device. The system automatically records the timestamp and verifies identity.
Attendance Report: Admins can generate attendance reports for both students and staff, including details such as late arrivals and absences.
6. Subscription & Payment Management
Subscription Types: The app supports multiple subscription plans (6 months, 1 year, etc.). Admins can manage subscription packages for the institution.
Payment Tracking: Admins can track payments for tuition fees and other services. Payment statuses can be updated manually or automatically based on online payment integration.
Automatic Access Control: Based on subscription status, the app will automatically control access for users. For example, if a subscription expires, the student or staff account may be temporarily disabled until payment is confirmed.

9. User Management
Role-Based Access Control: Different user roles (admin, student, staff) have different levels of access. Admins can create new roles, modify permissions, or deactivate users.
Password Reset: If a user forgets their password, they can initiate the password reset process, with admins overseeing the final reset.
10. Settings
General Settings: Admins can configure system-wide settings like school details, time zone, and app theme.
Biometric Settings: Manage biometric device settings for attendance tracking.
Subscription Settings: Adjust subscription plan details and payment integration settings.
